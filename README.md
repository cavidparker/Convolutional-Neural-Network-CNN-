# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vison that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).
## Step -1 : Convolution :
## Step -2 : Max pooling
## Step -3 : Flattening
## Step -4 : Full Connection

### from keras.models import Sequential :
To inisialize our Neural Network
### Convolution 2D:
- use it for the frist layer,2D use it for images and 3D use it for Videos
### MaxPooling 2D:
- that make out pooling layer, normally we use 2*2 matrix because we don't want to lose any data.
### Flatten :
- convert all the pool feature map into the large feature vector that will be our fully connected layed
### Dense :
- Add the fully connected layers in a classic ANN
